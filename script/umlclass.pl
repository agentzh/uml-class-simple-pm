=head1 NAME

umlclass.pl - Utility to generate UML class diagrams from Perl source or runtime

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # generate a PNG file for the Foo module:
    $ umlclass.pl -M Foo -o foo.png -p "^Foo::"

    # generate an SVG image file which is vectorized and super clear:
    $ umlclass.pl --without-inherited-methods -o foo.svg -r lib/

    # generate the dot source file:
    $ umlclass.pl -M Foo -o foo.dot

    $ umlclass.pl -o bar.gif -p "Bar::|Baz::" lib/Bar.pm lib/*/*.pm

    $ umlclass.pl -o blah.png -p Blah -r ./blib

    $ umlclass.pl --without-inherited-methods -o blah.png -r lib

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple command-line frontend for the L<UML::Class::Simple> module.

I'll illustrate the usage of this tool via some real-world examples.

=head2 Draw Stevan's Moose

  $ umlclass.pl -M Moose -o samples/moose_small.png -p "^(Class::MOP|Moose::)" -s 4x8

This command will generate a simple class diagram in PNG format for the Moose module
with classes having names matching the regex C<"^(Class::MOP|Moose::)">. The image's
width is 4 inches while its height is 8 inches.

We need the -M option here since C<umlclass.pl> needs to preload L<Moose> into the
memory so as to inspect it at runtime.

The graphical output is given below:

=begin html

<img src="http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/moose_small.png">

=end html

(See also L<http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/moose_small.png>.)

Yes, the image above looks very fuzzy since the whole stuff is huge. If you strip
the -s option, then the resulting image will enlarge automatically:

  $ umlclass.pl -M Moose -o samples/moose_big.png -p "^(Class::MOP|Moose::)"

The image obtained is really really large, I won't show it here, but you
can browse it in your favorite picture browser from
L<http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/moose_big.png>.

Before trying out these commands yourself, please make sure that you have
L<Moose> already installed. (It's also on CPAN, btw.)

=head2 Perl libraries that use Moose

Perl classes that inherit from Moose will have tons of "meta methods" like
C<before>, C<after>, C<has>, and C<meta>, which are not very interesting
while plotting the class diagram. So it's common practice to specify
the C<--without-inherited-methods> option like this:

  $ umlclass.pl --without-inherited-methods -o uml.png -r lib

If you also add C<--moose-roles>, extra edges will appear in the
graph, in an alternate color, representing the relationships between roles
and their consumers.

=head2 Draw Alias's PPI

  $ umlclass.pl -M PPI -o samples/ppi_small.png -p "^PPI::" -s 10x10

=begin html

<img src="http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/ppi_small.png">

=end html

(See also L<http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/ppi_small.png>.)

Or the full-size version:

  $ umlclass.pl -M PPI -o samples/ppi_big.png -p "^PPI::"

(See L<http://perlcabal.org/agent/images/ppi_big.png>.)

BTW, L<PPI> is a prerequisite of this module.

=head2 Draw FAST.pm from UML::Class::Simple's Test Suite

  $ umlclass.pl -M FAST -o samples/fast.png -s 5x10 -r t/FAST/lib

This is an example of drawing classes contained in Perl source files.

=head2 Draw Modules of Your Own

Suppose that you're a CPAN author too and want to produce a class diagram for I<all>
the classes contained in your lib/ directory. The following command can do all the
hard work for you:

    $ umlclass.pl -o mylib.png -r lib

or just plot the packages in the specified .pm files:

    $ umlclass.pl -o a.png lib/foo.pm lib/bar/baz.pm

or even specify a pattern (in perl regex) to filter out the packages you want to draw:

    $ umlclass.pl -o a.png -p "^Foo::" lib/foo.pm

Quite handy, isn't it? ;-)

=head1 IMPORTANT ISSUES

Never feed plain module names to F<umlclass.pl>, for intance,

  $ umlclass.pl Scalar::Defer  # DO NOT DO THIS!

will lead you to the following error message:

  error: input file Scalar::Defer not found.

Use C<-M> and C<-p> options to achieve your goals:

  $ umlclass.pl -M Scalar::Defer -p "Scalar::Defer"

In this example, I must warn you that you may miss the
packages which belong to Scalar::Defer but don't have "Scalar::Defer"
in their names. I'm sorry for that. F<umlclass.pl> is not I<that>
smart.

The safest ways to do this are

=over

=item 1.

Don't specify the C<-p regex> option and generate a large image which shows
every classes including CORE modules, figure out the appropriate class
name pattern yourself, and rerun C<umlclass.pl> with the right regex pattern.

=item 2.

Grab the Scalar::Defer's tarball, and do something like this:

   $ umlclass.pl -r Scalar-Defer-0.07/lib

=back

It's worth mentioning that when .pl or .pm files are passing as the command line
arguments, I<only> the classes I<defined> in these files will be drawn. This is
a feature. :)

For F<.pm> files on your disk, simply pass them as the command line
arguments. For instance:

   $ umlclass.pl -o bar.gif lib/Bar.pm lib/*/*.pm

or tell F<umlclass.pl> to iterate through the directories for you:

   $ umlclass.pl -o blah.png -r ./lib

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --color color

=item -c color

Sets the node color. Defaults to C<#f1e1f4>.

You can either specify RGB values like C<#rrggbb> in hex form, or
color names like "C<grey>" and "C<red>".

=item --dot path

Tell it where the graphviz "dot" program is

=item --exclude path

=item -E path

excludes modules that were installed to C<path> from
the drawing. multiple C<-E> options are supported.

=item --help

=item -h

Shows the help message.

=item --include path

=item -I path

Draws I<only> the classes that were installed to
C<path> in the drawing. multiple C<-I> options are supported.

=item -M module

Preloads the module which contains the classes you want to depict. For example,

    $ umlclass.pl -M PPI -o ppi.png -p "^PPI::"

Multiple C<-M> options are accepted. For instance:

    $ umlclass.pl -M Foo -M Bar::Baz -p "Class::"

=item --no-methods

Don't display method names in the output.

=item --no-inheritance

Don't show the inheritance relationships in the output.  Not terribly useful
unless you are using C<Moose> and asking for C<--moose-roles>.

=item --out outfile

=item -o outfile

Specifies the output file name. Note that the file extension will be honored.
If you specify "C<-o foo.png>", a PNG image named F<foo.png> will be generated,
and if you specify "C<-o foo.dot>", the dot source file named F<foo.dot> will
be obtained.
If you specify "C<-o foo.xmi>", the XMI model file will be generated.
Likewise, "C<-o foo.yml>" will lead to a YAML file holding the whole
internal DOM data.

A typical usage is as follows:

    $ umlclass.pl -o foo.yml lib/Foo.pm

    # ...edit the foo.yml so as to adjust the class info
    # feed the updated foo.dot back
    $ umlclass.pl -o foo.dot foo.yml

    # ...edit the foo.dot so as to adjust the graphviz dot source
    # now feed the updated foo.dot back
    $ umlclass.pl -o foo.png foo.dot

You see, F<umlclass.pl> allows you to control the behaviors at several different
levels. I really like this freedom, since tools can't always do exactly what I want.

If no C<-o> option was specified, F<a.png> will be assumed.

=item --pattern regex

=item -p regex

Specifies the pattern (perl regex) used to filter out the class names to be drawn.

=item --public-only

=item -P

Shows public methods only.

=item --recursive

=item -r

Processes subdirectories of input directories recursively.

=item --moose-roles

If a package appears to be a L<Moose::Role>, determine which other
packages consume that role, and add that information to the graph
in a different color from the inheritance hierarchy.  Depending on
the particular input classes and your personal artistic tastes,
this may substantially alter the usefulness and/or cleanliness of
the resulting diagram.  For large package hierarchies, it is
recommended to combine this with B<--no-inheritance>.

=item --size

=item -s <w>x<h>

Specifies the width and height of the resulting image. For example:

    -s 3.6x7

    --size 5x6

where the unit is inches instead of pixels.

=item --without-inherited-methods

Do not show methods from parent classes.

All inherited and imported methods will be excluded. Note that if a method
is overridden in the current subclass, it will still be included even if
it appears in one of its ancestors.

=back

=head1 TODO

=over

=item *

If the user passes plain module names like "Foo::Bar", then its (and only its)
ancestors and subclasses will be drawn. (This is suggested by Christopher Malon.)
